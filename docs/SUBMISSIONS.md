**Entry:**

```markdown
- [Memoire](https://github.com/sarveshsea/m-moire) by [sarveshsea](https://github.com/sarveshsea) - Registry-first design system CLI and MCP server. Publish Figma or tweakcn systems to npm, install components with `memi add`, and connect Claude Code to the same workflow with `memi mcp config --install`.

**Category:** Server Implementations > Design

**Entry:**

```markdown
- [Memoire](https://github.com/sarveshsea/m-moire) 📇 🏠 - Registry-first design system MCP server. Publish installable registries from Figma or tweakcn, pull tokens from Figma or Penpot, generate shadcn/ui code, and connect the workflow to Claude Code with `memi mcp config --install`.
```

## 3. Show HN Post

**Title:** Show HN: Publish your Figma design system as an installable npm registry

**Body:**

```
I built Memoire — a registry-first CLI + MCP server for design systems.

  npx @sarveshsea/memoire publish --name @acme/ds --figma https://figma.com/design/xxx --push

That turns a Figma file into an npm package with tokens, specs, and real components.

Then in any shadcn app:

  npx @sarveshsea/memoire add Button --from @acme/ds

It also works as an MCP server for Claude Code / Cursor, so the same registry workflow can be driven from AI tools.

There is also a `design-doc` path if you want to start from a public site URL instead of Figma.

## 4. Twitter/X Thread

**Tweet 1 (hook):**
```
i built a CLI that turns a Figma design system into an installable npm registry

npx @sarveshsea/memoire publish --name @acme/ds --figma https://figma.com/design/xxx --push

then from any shadcn app:
npx @sarveshsea/memoire add Button --from @acme/ds

tokens + real components, not screenshots or specs only
```

**Tweet 2 (how it works):**
```
how it works:

1. pull from figma or load a tweakcn theme
2. package tokens + specs + generated code
3. publish to npm
4. install components anywhere with `memi add`

it’s basically the shadcn pattern for whole design systems
```

**Tweet 3 (MCP angle):**
```
it also runs as an MCP server

add to claude code in one command:
  memi mcp config --install

then your AI assistant can:
- pull tokens from figma or penpot
- generate shadcn/ui code from specs
- audit and sync the design system
- work against the same published registry
```

**Tweet 4 (CTA):**
```
MIT licensed. works offline. npm package + standalone binary.

github.com/sarveshsea/m-moire

try it:
  npx @sarveshsea/memoire publish --name @you/ds --figma [your-file]
```

4. Beyond extraction — full Figma-to-code pipeline
5. MCP server for AI coding tools
6. Try it now (npx one-liner)
