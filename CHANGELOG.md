### Key Design Decisions
- **Notes Become a Real Extension Surface** — Mémoire now treats Notes as installable skill packs, including workspace `SKILL.md` bundles, built-in notes, and compatibility fixes for activation and copy behavior.
- **Composable Agent Workflows** — Compose now resolves a concrete target spec before codegen, and the orchestrator no longer silently regenerates the full spec set for creation intents.
- **Machine-Friendly CLI Surfaces** — `status`, `notes list`, and `notes info` can emit clean JSON, which makes the CLI more usable for Codex, Claude, and other automation.
- **Fast Local Build Loop** — dedicated build config and build script reduce warm build latency and stop shipping unnecessary sourcemap artifacts during normal iteration.
- **Codex-Oriented Operating Guidance** — built-in notes now include Codex ops guidance, and core inventory commands expose more JSON so agent workflows can inspect specs and IA state without scraping prose.
- **Research Pipeline Becomes Scriptable** — research import, synthesis, and report commands now expose artifact paths and summaries in JSON, so automation can chain them without terminal scraping.
- **Workspace State Is Less Noisy** — generated atomic output and preview build artifacts are now treated as workspace state in git ignore rules, reducing irrelevant status noise during agent work.
- **Daemon Health Becomes Queryable** — `memi daemon status --json` now reports runtime ports, preview URL, uptime, Figma connection state, and stale-cleanup results so agents can check background state without parsing terminal prose.
- **Connect Setup Becomes Queryable** — `memi connect --json` now reports token/file-key discovery, plugin manifest resolution, bridge startup state, and next steps without dropping into prompts.
- **Onboarding Stops Rewriting Existing Workspace State** — `init` now preserves existing starter specs, project-context persistence keeps stable timestamps when nothing changed, and prototype output defaults under `.memoire/` instead of tracked source folders.
- **Runtime and Bridge Hardening** — Preview, the Figma bridge, signal handling, and listener management were tightened so bind failures and cleanup paths surface clearly.
- **Modern Project Detection and Packaging** — Tailwind v4, shadcn, plugin manifest access, postinstall behavior, and npm packaging were hardened for current app layouts.
- **Plugin Bundles Become Generated Artifacts** — The Figma widget source now lives under `src/plugin/` as typed main/UI/shared modules, while `plugin/code.js` and `plugin/ui.html` remain checked-in build outputs for npm packaging and postinstall copy.
- **Bridge Compatibility Becomes an Explicit Adapter** — The plugin UI, plugin main thread, and bridge server now share typed bridge envelopes in code while preserving the existing legacy WebSocket wire format for `command`, `response`, and passive bridge events.
- **Operator Console Optimizes for Triage** — The plugin panel now treats jobs and selected nodes as operational surfaces, with presenter-driven summaries, node quick actions, and richer selection diagnostics above raw logs.
- **Jobs Become Persistent Widget State** — The plugin main thread now owns a real job store, bootstrap can restore existing job state, reconnect downgrades active work explicitly, and sync/healer summaries persist in the operator console instead of vanishing into transient logs.
- **Canvas Agent Widgets Gain Stable Identity** — On-canvas agent boxes are now keyed by `{runId, taskId, role}`, seeded per plan, and updated through real idle/busy/done/error lifecycle transitions instead of overwriting a single role-based box.
- **Preview Gains Widget-Grade State** — The preview API now keeps a live cache of bridge, selection, job, sync, healer, and agent status so dashboards can query the same operational state the Figma widget sees.
- **Widget Bundle Health Becomes Explicit** — The build now emits widget metadata, postinstall records install state, and `connect` / `doctor` report whether the installed Control Plane bundle is built, current, and operator-ready.
- **Figma Imports Must Use a Copied, Runtime-Compatible Bundle** — The shipped widget now targets ES2019, build tests fail on leaked `??` / `?.`, postinstall dereferences the copied plugin bundle, and install health treats symlink-resolved imports as unsafe before Figma rejects them.
- **Figma Runtime Compatibility Is Enforced at an ES2017 Syntax Floor** — The shipped widget bundle now targets ES2017 so raw object spread is compiled away before import, and the build regression test now checks for parser-breaking object spread instead of relying on a broad regex.
- **Widget UI Bootstraps Only After the Mount Node Exists** — The operator console now waits for `DOMContentLoaded` before resolving `#app`, which keeps the inlined bundle from crashing when Vite hoists the script into `<head>`.
- **Preview Changelog Is Now Generated from CHANGELOG.md** — `preview/changelog.html` is no longer hand-synced via an embedded release array; the build regenerates it from `CHANGELOG.md`, and a regression test now fails if the checked-in preview page drifts from the changelog source.
- **Widget Typography Uses Local System Stacks** — The Figma panel no longer depends on remote Google Fonts, so the embedded webview renders with reliable mono and serif system fonts even when external font loads are blocked.
- **Widget Typography Now Carries Real Hierarchy** — The Control Plane now uses serif only for brand/section emphasis, sans for controls and values, and mono for operator metadata so the panel reads like a tool instead of one flat font block.
- **Widget Typography Now Has Real Hierarchy** — The Control Plane uses sans text for readable body and controls, reserves mono for operational metadata, and keeps serif accents only where they add identity, which makes the panel feel deliberate instead of uniformly thin.
- **Widget Density Now Prioritizes Operator Throughput** — The Control Plane opens shorter, collapses internal spacing, and removes artificial empty-state height so the Figma panel shows more state per viewport instead of spending its budget on whitespace.

### Changes
- Added the Notes ecosystem release, including audit fixes, activation cleanup, recursive-copy handling, and dead-code removal
- Added preview hot reload, doc-change polling, e2e tests, and npm packaging prep
- Added self-healing, Code Connect checks, and file watcher support
- Hardened the preview and Figma bridge stack with better error handling, signal cleanup, and bind diagnostics
- Improved command routing, plugin manifest access, and port/path detection for production use
- Added CLI ergonomics like `--format`, `dash` aliasing, hidden command registration, and JSON output
- Added regression coverage for compose targeting, export destinations, CLI registration, note installation, and packaged note assets
- Added the built-in Figma web capture note and fixed note hook documentation
- Added the built-in Codex ops note for JSON-first CLI usage, commit hygiene, and agent-safe repo workflows
- Improved project detection for Tailwind and shadcn setups and removed noisy logger transport warnings
- Sped up local TypeScript builds with a dedicated build config and restored the working fast-build script
- Added JSON output to `spec list` and IA `list`/`show`/`validate` so agents can inspect architecture state without terminal scraping
- Added JSON output to `notes install`, `notes create`, and `notes remove` so downloadable note workflows can be automated end to end
- Added JSON output to research `from-file`, `from-stickies`, `synthesize`, and `report` with artifact metadata and no human preamble noise in JSON mode
- Ignored generated atomic component folders, `.astro/`, and preview-generated workspace artifacts to reduce git noise during normal operation
- Synced changelog surfaces for the research and workspace-hygiene changes
- Added JSON output to `daemon status` with stale-cleanup reporting, uptime, and preview connection metadata
- Added JSON output to `connect` so automation can inspect setup state and bridge readiness without entering the guided prompt flow
- Made `init` idempotent for starter specs, kept `.memoire/project.json` stable across unchanged inits, and moved default prototype output under `.memoire/prototype`
- Added a dedicated `src/plugin/` TypeScript source tree for the Figma widget, with typed contracts, modular main/UI code, and a dedicated plugin build pipeline
- Rebuilt the shipped plugin bundles from source during `npm run build` and added regression coverage for generated `plugin/code.js` and `plugin/ui.html`
- Synced changelog surfaces for the plugin V2 foundation push
- Normalized the widget and bridge protocol with shared bridge contracts, a UI bridge-command adapter, additive session/run metadata, and legacy-wire compatibility for existing engine flows
- Synced changelog surfaces for the widget bridge protocol push
- Enhanced the operator console with job-overview summaries, per-node quick actions, richer selection state/layout details, and a presenter layer with regression coverage
- Synced changelog surfaces for the operator console workflows push
- Added persistent widget job state, reconnect-safe job degradation, bootstrap job restoration, and durable sync/healer summaries with dedicated regression coverage
- Synced changelog surfaces for the widget job state push
- Rewrote the canvas agent widget lifecycle with stable run/task identity, deterministic ordering, richer box content, and orchestration wiring backed by helper tests
- Added widget-aware preview endpoints for Figma status, jobs, selection, and agents, backed by a dedicated preview state cache and regression coverage
- Upgraded the preview gallery footer into a live control summary and published agent-status updates beyond the canvas so preview and the Control Plane share the same orchestration view
- Added widget build metadata, install metadata, and a new install-health resolver so the Control Plane bundle can be verified programmatically
- Upgraded `connect` and `doctor` to report widget version, bundle readiness, install freshness, and plugin health in both JSON and human-readable output, then aligned README, notes, and multi-agent guidance with the shipped Widget V2 behavior
- Downleveled the shipped Figma widget bundle to ES2019, rebuilt `plugin/code.js` and `plugin/ui.html`, and added regression tests that fail if modern syntax leaks into checked-in plugin assets
- Hardened postinstall to replace `~/.memoire/plugin` with a dereferenced copy, persist resolved install metadata, and warn when the safe copied import path cannot be created
- Expanded symlink-risk detection to catch imports resolved through linked paths, then updated connect and README guidance so users re-import from `~/.memoire/plugin/manifest.json` when Figma rejects a linked manifest
- Lowered the plugin bundle target from ES2019 to ES2017 so Vite compiles raw object spread out of both `plugin/code.js` and `plugin/ui.html`, which fixes the Figma parser failure at `...state.connection`
- Rebuilt the shipped widget artifacts and updated widget metadata after the ES2017 compatibility pass
- Tightened the plugin build regression test so it catches actual object spread in built artifacts without false-flagging safe array spread
- Fixed the blank widget panel by deferring UI bootstrap until `#app` exists, which prevents the inlined `plugin/ui.html` script from throwing before the body is parsed
- Replaced `replaceAll` in the plugin UI escape helpers with regex replacements to avoid another first-render compatibility trap in embedded runtimes
- Added build coverage that asserts the generated widget bundle includes the DOM-ready bootstrap path
- Added `scripts/build-changelog-preview.mjs` to parse `CHANGELOG.md`, normalize release data, and regenerate `preview/changelog.html` from the changelog source of truth
- Wired `npm run build` to refresh the preview changelog automatically and added `npm run build:changelog` for direct regeneration
- Added a regression test that compares the checked-in `preview/changelog.html` against generated output from `CHANGELOG.md`, so stale preview changelog data now fails locally
- Removed Google Fonts dependencies from the Figma widget UI, switched the operator console to local system mono/serif stacks, and added a build regression check so blocked web fonts do not silently ship again
- Strengthened the widget typography hierarchy by enlarging brand and section titles, increasing metric-value emphasis, and using a clearer sans treatment for tabs and operator controls
- Reworked the widget type hierarchy so operator copy and controls use a stronger sans stack, brand and section heads keep serif emphasis, and telemetry labels stay mono instead of flattening the whole panel into one weak font treatment
- Tightened the widget typography pass with a larger base text size, stronger control weights, clearer status pills, and better subtitle/chip readability inside the Figma panel
- Reduced the widget height, tightened panel and card spacing, turned the action row into a denser grid, and cut the operator tab panel minimum so the Figma plugin wastes less vertical space

## v0.2.0 — 2026-03-26

### Commits
| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `358c9e3` | Add 4 powerhouse Notes — deep skill packs (4,400+ lines) |
| `dbcb551` | Add Mémoire Notes — downloadable skill pack ecosystem |

### Key Design Decisions
- **Notes as First-Class Extension System** — Mémoire Notes are downloadable skill packs that extend what the engine can do. Each Note is a folder with `note.json` manifest + markdown skill files. Four categories: craft, research, connect, generate.
- **Three-Source Loading** — NoteLoader discovers notes from legacy `skills/registry.json`, built-in `notes/*/note.json` packages, and user-installed `.memoire/notes/`. User-installed override built-in by name.
- **Activation by Intent** — Notes are resolved per classified intent and injected into agent prompts. `activateOn` contexts map to IntentCategory with an 8K character limit for prompt injection.
- **Deep Skill Files** — Four powerhouse Notes ship built-in: self-improving-agent (628 lines), mobile-craft (1,466 lines), design-systems (1,411 lines), competitive-intel (894 lines). Real expertise, not templates.

### Notes System
- Added `src/notes/` module: types (Zod schemas), loader, resolver, installer, index
- Added `src/commands/notes.ts` with 5 CLI subcommands: install, list, remove, create, info
- Integrated NoteLoader into MemoireEngine (`engine.notes`)
- Agent orchestrator resolves and injects Notes per intent classification
- Status command shows Notes count
- Init command creates `.memoire/notes/` directory

### Key Design Decisions
- **Atomic Design Only** — Every generated component must declare an atomic level (atom, molecule, organism, template). Enforced in specs and codegen.
- **MCP Tool Decision Tree** — `use_figma` for design-system-aware ops, `figma_execute` for raw Plugin API. Check Code Connect BEFORE creating anything.
- **Self-Healing Loop** — Mandatory CREATE → SCREENSHOT → ANALYZE → FIX → VERIFY (max 3 rounds) for all canvas operations.
- **Code Connect First-Class** — Every ComponentSpec has a `codeConnect` field mapping Figma node IDs to codebase paths.
- **Multi-Agent Native** — Multiple Claude instances on ports 9223-9232. Color-coded box widgets in Figma (yellow=working, green=done, red=error).
- **AgenticUI Aesthetic** — Monospace terminal-paper aesthetic. Dark for system UI, warm paper for generated output. Gold accent (#9D833E).
- **Skills Architecture** — 10 skill files with freedom levels (maximum, high, read-only, reference).
- **Changelog Convention** — Claude updates this file after every Mémoire commit. User projects are tracked locally in `.memoire/`, not here.
- **Auto-Spec Engine** — `memi pull` automatically creates ComponentSpecs from Figma components. Infers atomic level, shadcn base, and props.
- **Single-Command Pipeline** — `memi go` runs connect → pull → auto-spec → generate → preview in one command.
- **Export to Project** — `memi export` copies generated code into the user's actual project tree.
- **Token-Aware Codegen** — Generated components inject CSS variable references from pulled design tokens.
- **Motion Video Skill** — `/motion-video` superagent for Apple-grade product animation, portfolio videos, motion tokens, Figma→AE pipeline.

### Changes
- Created `src/engine/auto-spec.ts` — auto-spec engine (Figma components → ComponentSpecs)
- Created `src/commands/go.ts` — single-command full pipeline
- Created `src/commands/export.ts` — export generated code to user project

- Created `preview/changelog.html` — timeline view with design decisions per version
- Upgraded all 9 skills against Figma MCP best practices
- Created 3 new skills: `DASHBOARD_FROM_RESEARCH.md`, `FIGMA_AUDIT.md`, `FIGMA_PROTOTYPE.md`
- Added animated 3D moon SVG to README header
- Complete ark → noche rename across 40+ files
- Updated `skills/registry.json` to v2.0.0
