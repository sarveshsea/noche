# Noche Changelog

Noche is an AI-native design intelligence engine. Designers use it to build their own products — connecting Figma, pulling design systems, generating production code.

This changelog tracks Noche itself: every version, commit, and architectural decision that shapes the tool.

### Key Design Decisions
- **Atomic Design Only** — Every generated component must declare an atomic level (atom, molecule, organism, template). Enforced in specs and codegen.
- **MCP Tool Decision Tree** — `use_figma` for design-system-aware ops, `figma_execute` for raw Plugin API. Check Code Connect BEFORE creating anything.
- **Self-Healing Loop** — Mandatory CREATE → SCREENSHOT → ANALYZE → FIX → VERIFY (max 3 rounds) for all canvas operations.
- **Code Connect First-Class** — Every ComponentSpec has a `codeConnect` field mapping Figma node IDs to codebase paths.
- **Multi-Agent Native** — Multiple Claude instances on ports 9223-9232. Color-coded box widgets in Figma (yellow=working, green=done, red=error).
- **AgenticUI Aesthetic** — Monospace terminal-paper aesthetic. Dark for system UI, warm paper for generated output. Gold accent (#9D833E).
- **Skills Architecture** — 9 skill files with freedom levels (maximum, high, read-only, reference).
- **Changelog Convention** — Claude updates this file after every Noche commit. User projects are tracked locally in `.noche/`, not here.

### Changes
- Rewrote `preview/design-system.html` — Noche's actual tokens, typography, components, atomic hierarchy
- Created `preview/changelog.html` — timeline view with design decisions per version
- Upgraded all 9 skills against Figma MCP best practices
- Created 3 new skills: `DASHBOARD_FROM_RESEARCH.md`, `FIGMA_AUDIT.md`, `FIGMA_PROTOTYPE.md`
- Added animated 3D moon SVG to README header
- Complete ark → noche rename across 40+ files
- Updated `skills/registry.json` to v2.0.0

## v0.0.1 — 2026-03-23

### Commits
| Hash | Message |
|------|---------|
| `199df7a` | Initial commit: Ark — AI-native Figma design intelligence engine |

### Key Design Decisions
- **Spec-First Architecture** — Every component starts as a JSON spec before code generation.
- **WebSocket Figma Bridge** — Auto-discovery on ports 9223-9232. Zero config.
- **shadcn/ui + Tailwind** — All generated code uses shadcn/ui and Tailwind CSS. Zod for validation.
- **Research Pipeline** — Excel/CSV import, Figma sticky extraction, AI synthesis, report generation.
- **Built for Claude** — CLAUDE.md + skills/ teach Claude to operate autonomously.

### Changes
- Initial codebase: engine, Figma bridge, research engine, spec system, codegen, preview server, CLI, TUI, Figma plugin, skills
